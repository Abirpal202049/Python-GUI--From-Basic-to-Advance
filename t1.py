# GUI -->  Graphics User Interface

from tkinter import * # tkinter is available for python 3
# * --> on the above line * means calling all the functions present in tkinter 
root = Tk() # it defines a instance of Tk() class/ # It actually build a basic GUI

# gui logic will be here
 
root.mainloop() # It is a EVENT LOOP it runs a infinite loop


# Question - Other than Tkinter what are the other ways to create a GUI in python
# Kivy, pyforms, pyGObject, pyQt, pyGUI, libavg, wxpython and tkinter..
